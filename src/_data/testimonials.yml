  content: I have a number of properties in the city on Airbnb. Not only does Betweenbnb handle the key hand-off, but literally everything in between. My guests love it and I love the 5-Star Ratings!

  title: "Happy Guests"

  content: Love! Love! Love it! We were traveling during our son’s birthday and our host hooked us up with Betweenbnb. They seriously couldn’t have made it more special. We arrived to a birthday cake, balloons and all kinds of activities for the kids. Oh, and wine for us! Highly recommend!
